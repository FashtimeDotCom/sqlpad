## Similar Projects

While working on SqlPad I ran across a few web-based projects that sort of overlap with what I was building. Some have a focus on visualization, some just writing SQL and other adminstrative tasks.

I haven't tried most of these out personally, but the look like they are worth checking out if you are looking for a web-app to execute SQL in. 

Have a project or product I can add to this list? Let me know via pull request, GitHub issue, or email to rick.bergfalk@gmail.com.



### Open Source, for Visualizing data

**[pgcharts](https://github.com/dimitri/pgcharts)**

Web app with a focus on charting query results. Simple interface, Postgres only.

**[FnordMetric](http://fnordmetric.io/chartsql/)**

Create charts using SQL with this web-based tool. Unsure of the databases supported, but it sounds like MySQL and CSV files

**[re:dash](https://github.com/EverythingMe/redash)**

Web application that allows you to query a variety of databases and share the dataset and visualize it in different ways, including dashboards.



### Open Source, general querying & DB Administration

**[pgweb](https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb)**

A Postgres only web app with a focus on writing SQL and exploring the structure of a database. Query results can be exported to CSV. Nice clean design. Likely target is database administration.

**[Adminer](http://www.adminer.org/)**

PHP based web sql admin tool with support for a variety of databases. Has a more old-web ui, but it covers a lot of ground and has been around for a while.
