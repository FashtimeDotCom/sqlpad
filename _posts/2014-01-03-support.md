## Support & Future of this Project

I started this project as a personal side-project so I could run queries from a chromebook and visualize the results with some simple visualizations. 

I no longer use my chromebook much, and I have ideas I want to explore in regards to querying and reporting off data in a relational database. 

Therefore, **I have no intention on taking this application further than it currently is.** 

That isn't to say that I won't occassionally add features to it or fix a bug here and there. I might. For now I'm considering this project "finished" and any future development will depend on whether I use it more on a regular basis.
