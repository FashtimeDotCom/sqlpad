## Contributing & Future of this Project

I started this project as a personal side-project so I could run queries from a chromebook and visualize the results with some simple visualizations. I have no intention on taking this application further than it currently is.

Would you like to contribute to SqlPad? Open a GitHub issue to discuss the addition or change. 
I will merge any pull requests for feature additions so long as  

- an issue is opened in advance to give a heads up
- the pull request is backwards compatible with the current version of SqlPad

If the pull request is for a bug fix no advance permission is necessary.
