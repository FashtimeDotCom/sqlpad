## [Contribute](https://github.com/rickbergfalk/sqlpad)

Do you know Node.js? Are you willing to explore someone else's code? Do you use SqlPad and wish it was different or better in some way?

Well you're in luck! 

[SqlPad is open open source](https://github.com/rickbergfalk/sqlpad), and I'm willing to merge in pretty much any pull request out there. 

I only ask 2 things: 

1. Please open a GitHub issue discussing the addition prior to starting on the work. This gives me and anyone else a heads up of the effort being done. 

2. Keep any current features/functionality of SqlPad intact. According to npm, there are people out there somewhere using this. I'd hate for them to be depending on it for anything too serious and something suddenly break for them :S

If you have any questions about any of it, feel free to open a GitHub issue to discuss. More often than not I'm thrilled to find out someone has bothered to read through and contribute to my code :)

And of course, if the pull request is for a bug fix no advance permission is necessary.
