## Contributing & Future of this Project

I started this project as a personal side-project so I could run queries from a chromebook and visualize the results with some simple visualizations. I have no intention on taking this application further than that, although I wouldn't be surprised if I change my mind about that.

I will merge any pull requests for feature additions so long as  

- the pull request is backwards compatible with the current version of SqlPad
- an issue is opened in advance to give a heads up  

If the pull request is for a bug fix no advance permission is necessary.
